## 🎯 Best Practices for Crisis Response

### **Communication Guidelines**

#### **DO:**
- ✅ **Use "we" language**: "We'll get through this together"
- ✅ **Validate feelings**: "What you're experiencing is really difficult"
- ✅ **Be specific**: "Here's a crisis text line: TEXT HOME to 741741"
- ✅ **Follow up**: Keep your promises to check in
- ✅ **Stay present**: Focus on their immediate needs and feelings
- ✅ **Use their name**: Personal connection helps build trust

#### **DON'T:**
- ❌ **Minimize feelings**: "It could be worse" or "Just think positive"
- ❌ **Give medical advice**: You're not their therapist or doctor
- ❌ **Make promises you can't keep**: Be realistic about what you can do
- ❌ **Share personal details**: Keep focus on them, not your experiences
- ❌ **Rush the conversation**: Let them share at their own pace
- ❌ **Assume you know their situation**: Ask questions and listen

### **Language That Helps**

#### **Validation Phrases:**
```
"That sounds incredibly difficult"
"I can understand why you'd feel that way"
"Your feelings make complete sense"
"You're dealing with a lot right now"
"It's okay to not be okay"
```

#### **Support Offers:**
```
"I'm here to listen for as long as you need"
"What would feel most helpful right now?"
"You don't have to face this alone"
"Would it help to talk about what's been hardest?"
"I believe in your strength, even when you don't feel strong"
```

#### **Resource Connections:**
```
"There are people specifically trained to help with this"
"Would you like me to help you connect with a crisis counselor?"
"Here's a resource that might be helpful: [specific resource]"
"Would you feel comfortable talking to a professional about this?"
```

### **Recognizing Your Limits**

#### **When to Escalate:**
- User mentions specific plans for self-harm
- Situation involves immediate physical danger
- User is under the influence and in crisis
- You feel overwhelmed or unsure how to help
- Professional intervention is clearly needed

#### **When to Take Breaks:**
- You've been responding to multiple crises in a shift
- You're feeling emotionally drained or triggered
- Personal stress is affecting your responses
- You need to process a particularly difficult situation

#### **Self-Care Reminders:**
- You can't save everyone, and that's not your job
- Taking care of yourself helps you take care of others
- It's okay to ask for help or backup
- Celebrate the connections you make, not just the outcomes

## 🧠 Working with Ash's Learning System

### **Teaching Ash About Your Community**

#### **Providing Feedback**
**When Ash gets it right:**
- Use the dashboard to mark "Accurate Detection"
- Note what specific indicators Ash identified correctly
- This reinforces good pattern recognition

**When Ash misses something:**
- Report "Missed Crisis" with details about the situation
- Explain what indicators should have triggered detection
- Provide the specific language or context Ash should learn

**When Ash has false positives:**
- Mark as "False Positive" and explain why
- Help Ash understand community slang or context
- Distinguish between serious concerns and casual expressions

#### **Community Language Evolution**
**New Terms and Phrases:**
```
Monthly team meeting discussion:
"I've noticed community members using [new term] to describe [feeling/situation]. 
Should we add this to Ash's monitoring?"
```

**Cultural Context:**
```
"In our community, when someone says [phrase], it usually means [context], 
not [potential misinterpretation]. Ash should learn this distinction."
```

**Gaming-Specific Language:**
```
"When discussing game frustrations vs. real-life frustrations, 
here are the indicators that help distinguish between them..."
```

### **Understanding Ash's Confidence Levels**
