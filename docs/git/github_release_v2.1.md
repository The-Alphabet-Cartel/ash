# 🚀 GitHub Release Management Guide v2.1 (Centralized Architecture)

**Repository:** https://github.com/the-alphabet-cartel/ash  
**Discord Community:** https://discord.gg/alphabetcartel  
**Website:** https://alphabetcartel.org

This guide covers release management processes for the Ash ecosystem using the centralized architecture with GitHub submodules.

---

## 📋 Release Overview

The Ash ecosystem follows a **coordinated release strategy** where individual components can be released independently, but ecosystem-wide releases coordinate all components for major updates. All components run as Docker containers on a single Linux server.

### 🏗️ Release Architecture

```
ash (Main Repository)                     # Ecosystem releases (v2.1.0)

## 🔧 Component Release Process

### Step 1: Prepare Component Release

**For any component (ash-bot, ash-nlp, ash-dash, ash-thrash):**

```bash
# Navigate to component directory
cd ash-bot  # or ash-nlp, ash-dash, ash-thrash

# Ensure you're on main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.4.2

# Update version numbers
# Update version in package.json, setup.py, or equivalent
# Update CHANGELOG.md with new features and fixes
# Update documentation if needed
```

**Version Number Guidelines:**
- **Patch (x.x.X):** Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Minor (x.X.x):** New features, backwards compatible
- **Major (X.x.x):** Breaking changes, major updates

### Step 2: Testing and Validation

```bash
# Run component-specific tests
npm test  # For ash-dash
python -m pytest  # For Python components

# Test in ecosystem context
cd ..  # Back to main ash directory
docker-compose build ash-bot  # Build only the component being released
docker-compose up -d ash-bot  # Deploy updated component

# Integration testing
cd ash-thrash
python src/comprehensive_testing.py

# Validate against main ecosystem
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

### Step 3: Create Component Release

```bash
# Finalize release branch
cd ash-bot  # or relevant component
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare release v1.4.2"
git push origin release/v1.4.2

# Create pull request for release branch
# Title: "Release v1.4.2"
